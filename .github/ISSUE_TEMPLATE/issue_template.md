# Do not create new Issues in this repository.

Please send bug reports or enhancement requests to the Octopus Deploy [support team](https://octopus.com/support).

### Background

This repository is a read-only mirror of code in our internal monorepo. 

It is not monitored; any issues created will not be responded to and may be automatically closed.

Please see [Changes to the Octopus C# client library open source repository](https://octopus.com/blog/changes-to-octopus-csharp-client-repository) on the Octopus Deploy blog for more information.

### Detail

We intend to disable the GitHub Issues feature for this repository to prevent creation of new issues, but doing so would remove access to historic issues. GitHub does not allow Issues to remain visible in a read-only manner at the time of writing.
